# NBA-Prediction-Project

This was a course final project aiming to use NBA team data to predict the outcome of individual NBA games. Machine learning models were built to carry out this prediction including logistic regression (Ridge), Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, and a MLP Neural Network. The data for teams used included basic statistics such as field goal percentages, three point field goal percent, free throw percentage, etc. There were also more advanced stats calculated through feature engineering including offensive rating, defensive rating, and ELO score. The data used was pulled from the python nba-api drawing from NBA.com. The models built were trained on all regular season games from 2012-13 season to the 2020-21 season. The models were tested on regular season games from the 2021-22 season. Included below is a table of our model performances. The random forest model performed best with 61.04% accuracy of predicting 2021-22 regular season game outcomes.
